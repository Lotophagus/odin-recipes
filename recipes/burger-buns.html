		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>125 grams Milk, lukewarm</li>
			<li>25 grams Yeast</li>
			<li>80 grams Granulated sugar</li>
			<li>3 Eggs</li>
			<li>500 grams Flour, hard</li>
			<li>10 grams Salt</li>
			<li>125 grams Butter, room temperature</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a mixer’s bowl add the milk, the yeast, the sugar, and mix with a hand whisk.</li>
			<li>Add the eggs, the flour, and salt. Ideally, cover with a tea towel and allow 15-20 minutes for the yeast to be activated.</li>
			<li>Beat with the hook attachment at high speed, for 6-8 minutes, until there is a dough.</li>
			<li>Add the butter into pieces and beat at low speed until it is incorporated.</li>
			<li>Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it double in volume.</li>
			<li>Cut into 10 pieces. Knead each one into a round dough piece and transfer to a baking pan lined with parchment paper. With a toothpick, make a hole in the center and cover with a tea towel. Let them rise.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 190ο C (370ο F) set to fan.</li>
			<li>As soon as the dough pieces rise, make -again- a hole in the center with the toothpick.</li>
			<li>Bake them for 10 minutes.</li>
